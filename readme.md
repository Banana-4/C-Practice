# ðŸ§  C Practice

This repository is my personal collection of C programs written to **practice core C concepts** and **solve algorithmic problems**.  
Itâ€™s a mix of small experiments, learning exercises, and working solutions â€” all aimed at getting better at **C programming** and **problem solving**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repo contains:
- ðŸ”¤ **Basic C concept practice:** syntax, loops, arrays, pointers, strings, memory handling, etc.  
- ðŸ§© **LeetCode-style problems:** algorithmic challenges implemented purely in C.  
- ðŸ’¡ **Explorations:** small test programs to understand how C works under the hood (e.g., `malloc`, stack behavior, string manipulation).
